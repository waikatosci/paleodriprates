# BayProX 0.1 (alpha)

## Introduction
**Bay**esian **ProX**y is a Python package that allows you to estimate proxy records or radiometrically dated sedimentary paleoclimatic archives. You can use this package to view your measured datasets, the relevant calibration curves pertinent to the age-depth information you need to estimate the proxy records, and finally, you can view the proxy records along with the uncertainty associated in their estimation.

The core analysis is based on the peer-reviewed journal article: Estimation of sedimentary proxy records together with associated uncertainty, *Quaternary Science Reviews* (*Under Review*).
